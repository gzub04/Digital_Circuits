# Laboratory tasks
1. Draw timing diagram or graph of the pulse detector
2. Transform it into the state transition and output table
3. Minimize and code the automaton
4. Draw excitation tables for SR flip flop realization
5. Simulate the circuits using Xilinx ISE

# Simulations in Xilinix ISE
- Draw the schematic in Xilinx ISE
- Create the testbench to the project
- Add excitation signals in the testbe n ch
- Simulate the circuit
- Perform troubleshooting if needed
