# Design datapath unit for a digital system computing average number.
## Laboratory tasks
### Assembly and simulate the circuit using Xilinx ISE:
1. Design the the data path unit.
2. Write the testbench that simulates calculations.
3. Run the program..
4. Show results.
5. Start with sequencer design.

## Simulations in Xilinx ISE
- Draw the schematic in Xilinx ISE
- Create the testbench to the project
- Add excitation signals in the testbench
- Simulate the circuit
- Perform troubleshooting if needed
