# Laboratory tasks
1. Draw graph of the 3-bit controlled counter
2. Transform graph into state transition and output table
3. Draw excitation tables for JK flip-flop realization
5. Simulate the circuits using Xilinx ISE
6. Report results

# Simulations in Xilinix ISE
- Draw the schematic in Xilinx ISE
- Create the testbench to the project
- Add excitation signals in the testbech
- Simulate the circuit
- Perform troubleshooting if needed
