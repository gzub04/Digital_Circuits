# Laboratory tasks : Part A
## Assembly and simulate circuit processing 4-bit numbers using Xilinx ISE:
1. Take two rightmost digits greater than 2 numbers from your student ID.
2. Load these numbers into registers A and B.
3. Clear register R and counter C.
4. Load register R.
5. Set c 0 =1 and load register.
6. Increment the counter 2 times.
7. Decrement the counter 4 times.

# Part B
1. Clear register R and counter C.
2. Load register R and increment counter C;
3. Repeat step 2 until counter is equal to register B
4. Set and reset flip flop (“1” indicates the moment, when result is valid)

# Part C
1. Load your numbers into registers A and B.
2. Clear register R and set C0 = 0.
3. If least significant bit of B is 1 load register R.
4. Shift left register A and shift right register B
5. Repeat steps 3-4 utill output of B becames 0.

# Simulations in Xilinix ISE
- Draw the schematic in Xilinx ISE
- Create the testbench to the project
- Add excitation signals in the testbe n ch
- Simulate the circuit
- Perform troubleshooting if needed
